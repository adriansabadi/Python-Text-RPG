# Python Text RPG

## A text-based RPG made with Python

### A quick introduction

Welcome to my Python Text RPG. This is a personal project in which I wanted to test my Python coding skills and OOP knowledge. The game still needs polishing but you can already play it if you have Python installed.

### How to play

To play the game, you must open the game.py file and it will open the console and start the game.

### Indications

To do the actions in the menus, you must type the number or letter that is next to the desired option. The -e command lets you exit most menus.
In battle you can type -help and it will show the battle commands.
The player character gets experience by defeating the enemies. When the character reaches a certain amount of experience points, their level increases and can use attribute points to upgrade the attributes and become more powerful.
You can buy items in the shops, there are 4 categories:

- Melee Weapons
- Ranged Weapons
- Armors
- Consumable Items

The character can equip the weapons and armor in-battle and use the consumables items.

### Important Notes

If you find any mistake please report it to me, including typos, since English is not my native language.
Also, sorry for the short README file, I want to improve it later, but I am still an beginner.
